**Plan Overview**

The AI bots will be integrated into Dinosaur World—a dinosaur-themed attraction—via **interactive kiosks**, each themed as a unique dinosaur character. These kiosks use the bots’ vast knowledge and capabilities to create an immersive, engaging experience that feels magical to visitors. A straightforward token system encourages interaction, while organic marketing drives attendance. Below are the key components:

**Key Components**

1. **Character-Based Interactive Kiosks**  
   * **What**: Place interactive kiosks at key spots in Dinosaur World. Each kiosk embodies a specific dinosaur character (e.g., "Terry the T-Rex" or "Sara the Stegosaurus") with a distinct personality and voice.  
   * **How**:  
     * Visitors interact with the dinosaur characters via a simple touch-screen interface.  
     * The AI bots provide fun facts, tell stories, and offer mini-games or quizzes related to their dinosaur species (e.g., a roaring contest with Terry or a plant-life puzzle with Sara).  
   * **Why Simple**: Uses basic kiosk hardware (screens and speakers) with pre-programmed AI responses, avoiding complex mobile apps or personal devices.  
2. **Token-Based Engagement System**  
   * **What**: Visitors earn digital tokens by engaging with the kiosks.  
   * **How**:  
     * Tokens are awarded for activities like answering quizzes correctly or completing games.  
     * Each visitor gets an **RFID wristband** to track tokens. They tap the wristband at kiosks to log interactions and check balances.  
     * Tokens can be redeemed at **redemption stations** for rewards (e.g., souvenirs, snacks, or exclusive exhibit access).  
   * **Why Simple**: RFID technology is inexpensive and reliable, requiring minimal infrastructure beyond the kiosks.  
3. **Exploration and Social Sharing**  
   * **What**: Encourage park-wide exploration and organic promotion.  
   * **How**:  
     * Dinosaur characters suggest visiting other kiosks (e.g., "Go meet my friend Sara\!") to earn more tokens and explore the park.  
     * Select kiosks offer **photo opportunities** with virtual dinosaurs, prompting visitors to share online with a park hashtag for bonus tokens.  
   * **Why Simple**: Relies on existing kiosk functionality and visitors’ own smartphones for sharing.  
4. **Organic Marketing and Partnerships**  
   * **What**: Drive attendance without paid ads.  
   * **How**:  
     * Offer bonus tokens for social media posts with a Dinosaur World hashtag.  
     * Partner with schools and educational groups, with AI bots delivering curriculum-aligned content for field trips.  
     * Introduce a **loyalty program** giving extra tokens for repeat visits.  
   * **Why Simple**: Uses word-of-mouth and existing networks, avoiding advertising costs.  
5. **Feedback Collection**  
   * **What**: Improve the experience and boost engagement.  
   * **How**: An exit kiosk asks for feedback via quick questions, making visitors feel valued and encouraging positive word-of-mouth.  
   * **Why Simple**: Adds minimal complexity to the kiosk system.

**How It Meets the KPIs**

* **Human Engagement**  
  * **Measurement**: Number of kiosk interactions, time spent per kiosk, and participation in games/quizzes.  
  * **Impact**: The quirky dinosaur characters and interactive content create a fun, immersive experience, keeping visitors engaged longer.  
* **Token Interactions**  
  * **Measurement**: Tokens earned and redeemed, plus top token-generating activities.  
  * **Impact**: The token system motivates visitors to interact with multiple kiosks and activities, deepening their experience.  
* **Financial Breakeven within 90 Days**  
  * **Measurement**: Revenue (ticket sales, in-park spending) versus costs (kiosks, wristbands, rewards, staffing).  
  * **Impact**:  
    * **Revenue**: Ticket sales and merchandise/food purchases (e.g., dinosaur character plush toys) fund operations.  
    * **Costs**: Kept low with simple kiosks and RFID tech.  
    * **No Paid Ads**: Organic buzz from social sharing and partnerships drives attendance.
