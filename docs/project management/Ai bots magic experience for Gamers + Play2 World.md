     * They provide real-time hints or tips when players struggle, enhancing accessibility and fun.  
     * Bots weave in game world stories or lore, making the environment feel dynamic and enchanting.  
   * **Tech Simplicity**: Relies on cloud-based AI with access to the game’s existing database. No advanced hardware or complex integrations—just an in-game interface for players to interact with the bots.  
2. **Token Reward System**  
   * **What**: Players earn tokens by completing bot-assigned quests and can spend them within the game.  
   * **How**:

     * Players can use tokens to purchase in-game items (e.g., skins, gear) or unlock premium features (e.g., exclusive quests).  
   * **Tech Simplicity**: A basic in-game wallet tracks token earnings and spending, building on the platform’s existing economy.  
3. **Organic Growth through Social Incentives**
