**Governance Contract:**

## **A. Objective & Solution Options & Prioritisation with Product & Tech Leads**

### **Objective**

The Governance Contract aims to enable **decentralised decision-making** within the Magic Worlds ecosystem. Token holders (MAGIC token holders) will be able to propose, vote on, and execute decisions that impact the ecosystem, such as:

* Adding new features to a world.  
* Adjusting tokenomics (e.g., inflation/deflation rates).  
* Allocating treasury funds.

### **Solution Options**

1. **Voting Mechanism**:  
   * **One Token, One Vote**: Each MAGIC token equals one vote.  
   * **Weighted Voting**: Voting power is proportional to the number of tokens held.  
2. **Proposal Types**:  
   * **Binary Proposals**: Yes/No votes (e.g., "Should we add feature X?").  
   * **Multi-Option Proposals**: Votes on multiple options (e.g., "Which feature should we prioritize: A, B, or C?").  
3. **Execution**:  
   * **Manual Execution**: Approved proposals are executed by an admin.  
   * **Automatic Execution**: Approved proposals trigger smart contract functions automatically.

### **Prioritisation**

* **Phase 1**: Implement **One Token, One Vote** with **Binary Proposals** and **Manual Execution**   
* **Phase 2**: Add **Weighted Voting** and **Automatic Execution**.
